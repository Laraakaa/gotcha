      First of all, don't panic. Nobody and nothing is in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this page opened automatically on your computer and you don't know why:
      it's because of the USB stick that you just plugged in.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may or may not wonder how an USB-Dongle is able to do things with your computer
      without your permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      TL;DR: You trusted something that you shouldn't. You thought that it would be
      an USB memory stick with an integrated storage, for example to transfer files to/from it.
      So you plugged it in and expected a window to open to transfer the files.
      In fact, you plugged in another keyboard that started to autonomously type
      and open this website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there is no problem with that, but there could also be other
      consequences including but not limited to
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Execution of malicious code (trojans/virus/bot networks)</li>
        <li>Theft of personal data (documents, images, everything on your hard drive)</li>
        <li>Doing things in your name on your pc, for example send an email via your configured address in outlook</li>
        <li>Access websites in your name, if you either have/had (same session) them open or when your browser fills in credentials automatically</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      I know it's hard to do, but we should start to question our trust in certain
      areas, like IT security.

      Please return the usb stick that you got to the person you got it from
      since this was only to raise awareness, and you cannot actually save
      something onto it.</p>
